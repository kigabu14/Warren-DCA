Confirming that the chosen AI provider is Gemini and the initial test ticker is AAPL. Next steps are: (1) implement baseline revert confirmation test, (2) add modular DCA files skeleton, (3) implement Fixed + Value Averaging strategies first, (4) wire Gemini provider abstraction in ai_dca_helper, (5) add multi-ticker UI with AAPL as default example, (6) then expand remaining strategies and optimizer. Would you like to add more tickers (e.g., MSFT, NVDA) or customize default parameter ranges before proceeding?
